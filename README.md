### Depreciation Notice

Here I attemted to make a data type with a common user-interface to store and
retrieve values, while hiding the actual implementaion from user
(eg. whether it is an array, list, tree, etc.)

It supports a standard Binary Search Tree and also a Red-Black Tree.

The main reason for this project was to learn how to work with Fortran's
polymorpfic objects and a hiearchy of user defined data types. Unfortunately,
the desing become unfeasibly complex and I am not happy how the code has
evolved.  Also, the library is not particularly as user-friendly as I hoped
it would be.

Therefore I will not continue with this project any longer.

Because red-black tree can be useful, I will move and reorganize the
implementaion of 'red-black tree' to another repository:
